Brandie Backend Engineer AssignmentThis repository contains the backend implementation for a minimal social media application, built to satisfy the requirements of the Brandie Backend Engineer Assignment. The solution is implemented using Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL.All core functionality—User Authentication, Social Graph Management (Follow/Unfollow), Posting, and Timeline Retrieval—has been completed and validated using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.Core Features ImplementedThe application supports the following functionality, verified by a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests:CapabilityGraphQL OperationDescriptionUser AuthenticationMutation.createUser, Mutation.loginHandles user creation, password hashing (bcrypt), and session management via JWT.User GraphMutation.followUser, Mutation.unfollowUser, Query.followers, Query.followingManages the social graph (who follows whom) using a dedicated Relation table in the database.PostingMutation.createPost, Query.postsAllows authenticated users to create text/media posts and retrieve a list of posts by any single user.Timeline FeedQuery.timelineRetrieves an authenticated user's chronological feed, combining their own posts and posts from all users they follow.🚀 Getting StartedThis application is fully Dockerized for ease of local setup and deployment.PrerequisitesDocker and Docker Compose installed.Node.js environment (for running tests).1. SetupClone the repository and install dependencies:git clone [YOUR_REPO_LINK]
cd brandie-backend
npm install
2. Configure Environment VariablesCreate a local .env file based on the example provided. This file defines database credentials, JWT secrets, and port configurations.cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set secure JWT_SECRET and confirm database URLs
3. Start the Database and Run MigrationsUse Docker Compose to start the PostgreSQL database and then run Prisma's initialization sequence.# Start the Postgres container (defined in docker-compose.yml)
docker-compose up -d

# Generate Prisma Client and apply migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
4. Run the BackendStart the development server:npm run dev
The GraphQL server will be available at: http://localhost:4000/5. Run Tests (Mandatory Validation)All code was developed using TDD. To ensure the current state is stable:npm test
🧠 Design and Architectural Decisions1. TDD and Project StructureMethodology: The entire project was built using Test-Driven Development (TDD). All business logic exists within Service classes (e.g., UsersService), which are covered by database-heavy Integration Tests (*.spec.ts). The API layer (resolvers) are covered by lightweight Unit Tests (*.resolver.spec.ts) that mock the services. This clearly separates business logic from API plumbing.Modularity: The application is organized by GraphQL modules (users, posts, follow) to maintain a clear separation of concerns.2. Technology ChoicesChoiceRationaleGraphQL (Apollo Server)Chosen over REST for its efficiency (fetching only required fields) and its power in querying graph-like data structures like the social feed and nested post authors.PostgreSQL 15 + PrismaPostgreSQL is a robust, ACID-compliant choice. Prisma is used as the ORM, simplifying schema management, migration, and the complex nested queries (like the getTimeline logic).AuthenticationJSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for a lightweight, stateless authentication scheme [cite: uploaded:BrandieBackendEngineerAssignment2025.pdf]. This simplifies scaling compared to stateful session cookies, requiring only the token to be present in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.3. Data Modeling (prisma/schema.prisma)Explicit Relation Table: Instead of a simple many-to-many relationship, an explicit Relation table was created. This approach allows for scalability and future features (e.g., adding a pending status for private accounts, or a timestamp for tracking follow duration).Timeline Optimization: The PostsService.getTimeline function uses a highly optimized single database query (prisma.post.findMany with an IN operator) to fetch all required posts and order them chronologically, minimizing round trips and ensuring efficiency for feed retrieval.🚧 Trade-offs and Future ImprovementsN+1 Resolution: To fully complete the GraphQL data model, a resolver for Post.author is technically required. Currently, the Post schema defines the author: User! field, but the Apollo Server is not explicitly told how to fetch the User object for every returned post. This usually involves defining a Post field resolver which would call UsersService.findUserById. This was left as the last logical step outside the core requirements.Security Headers/Rate Limiting: Production-ready APIs would require implementing rate limiting on the login and createUser mutations, and configuring HTTP security headers in the Apollo Server setup.
